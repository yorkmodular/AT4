# AT4 - Quad passive attenuator

A respin of my old QuadAtt quad attenuator - still fits inside 4HP but the layout is a bit more user-friendly (I hope)

A simple build, all you need are 8 PJ301M-12 (aka _ThonkIconn_) jacks and 4 9mm Alpha (or compatible) potentiometers.
Pot value is a matter of personal choice - audio or linear taper will work just fine; in terms of value I tend to use
either 50k or 100k depending on what I have to hand.

* _AT4-BOM.xlsx_ - the Bill Of Materials (not much to it)
* _AT4-panel.dxf_ - front panel in DXF format (ideal for laser cutters etc.)
* _AT4-panel.fpd_ - front panel in Schaeffer format
* _AT4-panel.kicad_pcb_ - KiCAD PCB file for front panel
